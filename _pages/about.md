**CS 395T: Advanced Topics in Systems and GenAI (Fall 2025)** is a graduate-level reading and project seminar investigating how *modern generative AI*—large language, vision and multimodal models—interacts with *computer systems*. We will study:
 * _Systems for GenAI_—scaling, serving, and optimising LLMs, diffusion and agentic workloads
 * _GenAI for Systems_—how foundation models can design, debug or operate complex infrastructure.

By the end of the semester you will have:
 * Surveyed the state of the art
 * Practiced critical paper reviewing
 * Explored research problems through a semester-long research project

The course is structured around lectures by the instructor [Aditya Akella](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~akella/), guest lectures, and paper readings/presentations by the students with open discussion. Details will be posted on the [**Schedule**]({{ '/schedule/' | relative_url }}) tab.  Students will form a project group (two or three students) and conduct a research project on systems and generative AI.

See the [**Logistics**]({{ '/logistics/' | relative_url }}) tab for detailed information on course organization and policies.

### What We Will Cover

A tentative reading list lives on the [**Reading List**]({{ '/reading-list/' | relative_url }}) tab and draws heavily from top systems and ML venues, including OSDI/SOSP, ASPLOS, SIGCOMM, NSDI, MLSys, ICLR, and NeurIPS.

#### Part 1 – LLMs as the Backbone of Modern AI  
* Parallel & elastic training (3D, MoE, fault-tolerance)  
* Networking for multi-datacentre scale  
* Low-latency, energy-aware inference & serving

#### Part 2 – GenAI Beyond Text  
* Diffusion and video generation systems  
* Retrieval-augmented pipelines and multi-agent orchestration  
* Cloud/edge schedulers for multimodal workloads

#### Part 3 – GenAI for Systems  
* AI-assisted formal verification, configuration and workload synthesis
* LLM-powered debugging, root-cause analysis & telemetry
