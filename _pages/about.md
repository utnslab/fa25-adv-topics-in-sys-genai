### Course Overview (TBD)

Welcome to CS 395T, Advanced Topics in Systems and GenAI! This is a graduate-level reading seminar on machine learning and computer systems. In this course we will explore the state of the art in how machine learning is being used in systems, why, and where there are opportunities for further advancement. The objectives of this course are:

* To understand the different types of systems problems to which machine learning can apply, understand the trajectory of the field both both the machine learning and systems side, and identify key open issues.
* To critically review research papers at the intersection of machine learning and systems.
* To explore research problems and investigate new ideas through a semester-long research project.

The course is structured around lectures by the instructor [Aditya Akella](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~akella/), guest lectures, and paper readings/presentations by the students with open discussion. Students will form a project group (two or three students) and conduct a research project on applying machine learning to systems.

### Topics (TBD)

* Why use machine learning in systems
* Types of systems problems to which learning applied, examples include:
  * Learned data structures
  * Leanred algorithms
  * Learning system configuration
  * Learning system controllers
  * Simulations and trace generation
  * Dealing with messy and unpredictable environments
* Open issues, including:
  * Suitable system support to enable low-overhead ML use
  * Lack of compositionality in, and guarantees for, learned algorithms
  * Integrating code and models
